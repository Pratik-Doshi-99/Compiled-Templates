# Compiled-Templates
FrontEnd (html, css, js) templates and their study notes.

This repository will maintain different front end code templates and the notes prepared while studying those templates
in a branch fashion. Each branch will represent a different template. Each template will have code files and notes (that
were made at the time those templates were studied/compiled)

The main branch will be used to create new branches. Thus it will not host any content directly, except for this readme files
and other common files as deemed fit from time to time.
